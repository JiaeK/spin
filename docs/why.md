# Why?

Reason and OCaml are by far my favourite languages! I've also worked on Elixir projects and saw with my own eyes how productive (and happy!) you can be with great tooling. I wish I had the best of both worlds: working with Reason and Ocaml and having a tooling worthy of Ruby on Rails.

On the other hand, I spend a large part of my time working on deployment pipelines, databases, micro-service communication, etc. It's hard to see how this aligns with the value of the product I work on, especially when it seems that I am doing the same things over and over again. I wanted to reduce the time I spend on this kind of thing.

Finally, another characteristic of Elixir and RoR ecosystems that I envy: all the projects have the same structure and use the same conventions. This is very powerful, and they achieve this by having official real-world templates. I hope Reason and OCaml communities will come to this one day, but of course, the community adoption of Spin is outside of my control, all I can do is build great templates that people enjoy! üòÅ
